# Deepfake-detection-based-on-VGG16-model

The identification of AI-generated faces is becoming increasingly difficult for humans, leading to potential societal issues. This project aims to classify fake facial images using VGG16 models. We use two datasets containing deepfake images and real face images to fine-tune the VGG16 model. Logistic regression is used as the baseline model. Tranditional 2D CNN is also used as a comparison.

The two datasets: 
1. Real vs Fake Faces - 10k dataset.   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachchitkunichetty/rvf10k/data
2. Real and Fake Face Detection Dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ciplab/real-and-fake-face-detection

The codes are in the Jupiter notebook file. It contains data preprocessing, data augmentation, model training, and testing.
